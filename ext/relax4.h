 * original source:
 * ALL PROBLEM DATA SHOULD BE LESS THAN LARGE IN MAGNITUDE, AND LARGE SHOULD BE
 * LESS THAN, SAY, 1/4 THE LARGEST INTEGER*4 OF THE MACHINE USED.  THIS WILL
 * GUARD PRIMARILY AGAINST OVERFLOW IN UNCAPACITATED PROBLEMS WHERE THE ARC
 * CAPACITIES ARE TAKEN FINITE BUT VERY LARGE.  NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT AS IN ALL
 * CODES OPERATING WITH INTEGERS, OVERFLOW MAY OCCUR IF SOME OF THE PROBLEM DATA
 * TAKES VERY LARGE VALUES.
 *
 * Edge capacities must be non-negative and less than or equal to
 * <tt>large</tt>, and edge costs should not exceed <tt>large/10</tt> in
 * absolute value, in order to avoid overflow (see RELAX4_DEFAULT_MAX_COST).

 *
 * There can be only one relax4 problem active at a time, because it currently
 * uses global state.

 * The caller is responsible for allocating (and later freeing) the arrays

 * is numbered 1.
 *
 * @param[in] end_nodes index of node at the end of each arc; the first node
 * is numbered 1.
 *
 * @param[in] costs cost for each arc; negative costs are allowed; negative cost
 * cycles are allowed (flows on edges involved in such a cycle are set to
 * <tt>large</tt>); absolute values of costs must be less than <tt>large</tt>
 * and should be less than <tt>large/10</tt> to avoid overflow (see

 * surplus node; demands should balance (sum to zero), or else the problem will
 * be infeasible.
